now we want to create a folder in the my work(d) so we entered a cmd is :
mkdir backend_project (backend_project: it is the what you want to put a name for your project or folder name)
 
okay now a backend_project folder created in the my work(D) and i want to told some thing is mkdir means make a directory okay
